# Project: Credit Default Prediction

**Business Problem**

Financial institutions need to anticipate credit risk in order to take proactive actions and reduce potential losses. 
The ability to predict whether a client will default on their next payment allows banks to intervene early through risk mitigation strategies such as customer outreach, credit restructuring, or reserve planning. 

**Objective**

Given a client with an active credit account, the goal of this project is to predict whether the client is likely to default on their next payment based on behavioral features. 

**Key Questions**
- Will the client default on their next payment?
- Which features and behavioral patterns are the strongest indicators of default risk?
  
**Approach**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand client behavior and risk patterns.
- Feature engineering and handling of correlated variables.
- Supervised machine learning models for binary classification metrics.
- Feature importance and interpretability analysis.

**Outcome**

The final model provides: 
-  2 models with a 100% accuracy that predict the probability of a client to default its payment.
-  A list of features that where the most important for the training.
